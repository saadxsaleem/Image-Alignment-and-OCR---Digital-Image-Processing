# Image-Alignment-and-OCR---Digital-Image-Processing

A comprehensive application designed to enhance document processing and analysis. This application seamlessly aligns documents based on their contours, ensuring precision in their presentation.

Key features of the project include:

Document Alignment: The system aligns document images by detecting their edges and contours, then applying a perspective transformation to correct orientation and achieve a top-down view. This meticulous alignment ensures accuracy for subsequent processing.

Image Filters: Offers various filters to enhance the image quality, including adjustments for brightness, saturation, and rotation. These tools allow for fine-tuning and optimizing the appearance of documents.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Implements advanced OCR technology to extract and recognize text from aligned images. This functionality enables the automatic detection of textual content.

Text Extraction: Once text is recognized, it can be downloaded as a notepad file, facilitating easy access and further processing of the documentâ€™s content.
